Details:
The game is divided into 4 levels. Each of increasing difficulty.
To pass a level, one must score at least a 100 points.
The points distribution is as follows:
Any ball with a board : +5
Green : +10
Blue : +20
Pink : +50
Porcupine : -50

Levels:
Level 1: Only three kinds of objects. Balls with boards. Green and Blue ball.
Level 2: The previous set of objects, along with Pink Balls and a flying platform. The flying platform is a small moving surface which provides access to the higher Pink balls. On top of the surface is a material which increases the player's upward speed upto a certain limit. Beneath it is a sticky surface which disables all motion until the platform slides away.
Level 3: The previous set of objects, along with porcupines. Porcupines are moving objects which, when touched results in a deduction of 50 points.
Level 4: The previous set of objects, minus porcupines, along with a small pond and a large bar magnet. The pond is an underground water body which decelerates any kind of motion when the player is inside it. The magnet is located at the far end of the level. It attracts the player towards it with a constant force.
